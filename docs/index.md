## User app commands
Not all commands are available if you use Nizubot as a user app. If a command is available on the user app, it will say so in the commands page.

Most user app commands also has an optional `ephemeral` field which decides if the message should be hidden from others. Defaults to `False`, so other users will see it. If there is no ephemeral option and the command is on the user app, it will always be hidden.
